    <h2 style="background-color: beige; width: fit-content;">My background study</h2>
    
    <p align="justify" style="background-color: beige;"> <font size="04">Assalamualaikum and hi! My name is Umi Masyitah, most people called me Umi. I am 20 years while making this website and I am literally doing this while I am having a very painful headache but I am still manage to finish this.
        Basically, this part is about my study background and I am currently studying at UiTM Rembau in Diploma Information Science as a part 5 student which I am in my final year. I will finish my diploma study in few weeks and going to leave this campus proudly as I have done everything my best.
        I love my diploma journey a lot because I have made some good friends along my journey here.
        
    <p align="justify" style="background-color: beige;"> <font size="04"></font>In my part 1 era, where I got no one and I trust no one, some people have adopted me and we became friends. But today we have separated our ways and we dont know each other anymore. I believed that they are having their bet of time now as I am. I have never felt
        regret as I learned a lot of goof things and I trust in Allah's plan that everything happened for a reason.</font>

    <p align="justify" style="background-color: beige;"> <font size="04">Back then when I was still in my highschool, I studied in SMK Sungai Besar, and basically I lived in hostel for several years. I got 6A's in PT3, I am happy for that, really happy but sadly everything turns blue as not everyone being for my results because I didn't manage to pass in Math.
        I had a best journey in highscool because I joined Silat Club as I loved the sport my whole heartedly. I also got gold medal in few competition I joined.</font>

    <p align="justify" style="background-color: beige;"> <font size="04">I learned so many things as I got a quote by myself sounds,</font>
    <blockquote><font size="05" style="background-color: beige;"><b>Hardship creates nothing but a better you.</b></font>
    </blockquote>
